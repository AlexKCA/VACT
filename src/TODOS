 a base class WordProcessor, and then descendants WordFormatter which will do line wrapping and buffer length and WordColorizer which will do color and italics

How it will work

Base abstract class:
    Basic is gonna get a block and have do punct inside of it

Wrapper class
    If there needs to be a newline then wrapper adds a newline

Colorizer class
    If there needs to be colors then color class does the colors

Optional
Auto WORD_BUFFER_SIZE
Add multiple languages
