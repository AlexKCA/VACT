Note: this project, as of now, is setup for only one language
to add multiple languages you could take the dictionary and files dirs
and put them into a parent dir

e.g., you could have
VACT/res/German
VACT/res/French
VACT/res/Swedish

and these would each have their own dictionaries and text files
