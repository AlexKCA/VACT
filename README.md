# Vocab Acquisition & Comprehension Tool (VACT) - CIS 278

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/AlexKCA/VACT.git
```

## Dependencies
NOTE: This project depends on ncurses.h which is a Unix library. *It has only been tested on Linux*, but MacOS and other Unix-based OSs should work. 

If you are using Windows, [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) should allow you to run this project. However, I haven't specifically tested it. Alternatively, you could use a full-on virtual machine. However, WSL is more convienient.

To build this project, you will need g++ and ncurses.h
Debian-based
```
sudo apt install g++ libncurses-dev
```
Arch
```
sudo pacman -S ncurses gcc
```
